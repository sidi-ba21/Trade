The project
----
Since 2002, **trading robots**, AKA **algorithmic trading**, are considered to be one of the major breakthroughs on financial markets over the last decade. In concrete terms, these bots’ mission is to evaluate a share’s quotation, and to react by deciding to either **buy or sell, through an automated process**.These trading bots are able to compute thousands of orders per second (this is called High Frequency Trading) which in return, of course, modifies the very nature of markets. They are not merely trading spots anymore, but have become fighting arenas for various devices of artificial intelligence.
Besides, this very promising field is still widely open; which is why the best scientists in the world are working on it. You are one of them. 

You have to create a trading bot that will bring about a revolution of the trade markets.
